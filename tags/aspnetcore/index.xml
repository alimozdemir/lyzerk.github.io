      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rather than reinventing the wheel, you may need a fast and reliable solution in a short time span. In this case, your framework should be able to support all your requirements. ASP.NET Core is doing that very well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using Hangfire for almost 2 years. It’s a wonderful job schedule API with persistent storage. Community have a lot of examples about how to use Hangfire. However, almost all of them use the application (UI) as a hangfire server. Here, I will explain how to use Hangfire with docker and multiple servers. Let’s begin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>At the beginning of the semester, I took software engineering course which has a term project. It requires us to do real-time web application. After discussion with team members, we chose ASP.NET Core with SignalR. While I was writing this story, SignalR is on alpha stage (1.0.0-alpha2). Therefore, it has issues. Such as, the documentation is incomplete, some of the features are under development and there is no information about unit testing or functionality testing etc.</description>
