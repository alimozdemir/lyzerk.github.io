      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using Hangfire for almost 2 years. It’s a wonderful job schedule API with persistent storage. Community have a lot of examples about how to use Hangfire.

      <description>Existing tools for monitoring the quality of codebases modified by multiple developers tend to be centralized and inflexible. These tools increase the visibility of quality by producing effective reports and visualizations when a change is made to the codebase and triggering alerts when undesirable situations occur. However, their configuration is invariably both (a) centrally managed in that individual maintainers cannot define local rules to receive customized feedback when a change occurs in a specific part of the code in which they are particularly interested, and (b) coarse-grained in that analyses cannot be turned on and off below the file level.</description>
