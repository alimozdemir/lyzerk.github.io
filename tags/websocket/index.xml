      <description>At the beginning of the semester, I took software engineering course which has a term project. It requires us to do real-time web application. After discussion with team members, we chose ASP.NET Core with SignalR. While I was writing this story, SignalR is on alpha stage (1.0.0-alpha2). Therefore, it has issues. Such as, the documentation is incomplete, some of the features are under development and there is no information about unit testing or functionality testing etc.</description>
